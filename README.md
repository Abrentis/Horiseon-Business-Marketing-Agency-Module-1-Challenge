# Horiseon Business Marketing Agency

## Description

In an age of rapidly advancing technology, websites need to meet accessibility standards for all different kinds of users.
For users incapable of viewing pictures on a webpage, one way to make these images accessible is through providing alternative text for screen-readers to access, or for users to read if the images do not load on to the page.

By applying this concept to Horiseon's website, I was able to optimize its functionality for various users. Additionally, by providing a description for both the title and images, this provides more keywords that can appear in search engines.

Through making these changes, I was able to practice methods on improving accessibility within a webpage, as well as cleaning code to make it appear clear and concise for other programmers editing the code.
